Deploy Static Website on AWS (DevOps Udacity First Course)

Cloud Fundamentals Project:
The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project, I deploy a static website to AWS. First, I create a S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket. Next, I configure the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies. Next, I speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™ content distribution network service, CloudFront. Lastly, I access your website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.

I take a screenshot the results of each of your steps and submit the screenshots in a zipped folder when you are done.
